## Resources

Of course, when I first started researching this project, I wanted to make sure I understood the game, so I researched this on  [Battleship Game - Wiki.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) <br>
YouTube as always is a great source of inspiration and guidence, [Knowledge Mavens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1WRCrd_HQ), and  [Python Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwpS_ac8uk0&t=1s) were incredibly useful for visualising what I was creating and giving me an idea about how I wanted my project to look like. <br>
As always, I used code snippets and ideas from Mozilla Developer Docs, Stack Overflow and w3school. <br>
Additionally, I referred to the [Python Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). <br>


## Instructions
This is a straightforward Battleship game implemented entirely in Python, where you compete against an AI opponent.<br>
The system is designed to be user-friendly and can adapt to suit your requirements. It provides a straightforward function that facilitates the gameplay.<br>

In this game, your goal is to locate and obliterate your adversary's vessels.<br> 
You commence the game by strategically placing your 5 battleships in either horizontal or vertical positions on your grid. The positioning of your ships is crucial, so make sure to think about it carefully.<br>

As the game progresses, your task is to guess the location of your opponent's ships. If your guess is correct, you reveal part of the enemy's ship. Your goal is to sink all your enemy's ships before they sink yours. <br> 
So, get ready to strategize, guess, and aim carefully to defeat the enemy and claim victory over the sea! <br>

## Testing

I tested this project (without the comments) and I am satisfied with the result.  <br>
I also had some friends test my game, which they all had positive experiences with it. <br>

### Strengths and Achievements

This project was a rewarding journey that pushed my Python skills to new levels:

1. **Battleship Logic Implementation**: I successfully implemented the rules of the popular game Battleship using Python. This involved understanding the game's mechanics and translating them into effective code.

2. **Application of Python Concepts**: I effectively used various Python concepts, including lists, loops, and functions. This project offered a practical scenario for applying these concepts, reinforcing my understanding.

3. **Problem-Solving Skills**: The project improved my problem-solving abilities, as I had to decompose the game's complex mechanics into solvable tasks. It also honed my skills in handling edge cases.

4. **User Interaction**: Despite the game's textual nature, I managed to design an intuitive user interface with clear instructions and prompts, providing a decent user experience.

### Learning and Growth Opportunities

While I'm proud of this work, I recognize that there are areas for improvement and growth:

1. **Code Structure**: For future projects, I aim to improve code modularity, breaking larger functions down into smaller, more manageable components. This will improve readability and make debugging simpler.

2. **UI/UX Improvements**: Although the user interface is functional, I can enhance user engagement by developing a more dynamic UI, possibly by leveraging GUI libraries such as Tkinter or Pygame.

3. **Error Handling**: This project has shown me the importance of robust error handling. In the future, I plan to build more comprehensive error checks to catch and handle exceptions effectively.

4. **Better Documentation**: I have learned that good documentation goes a long way in making the code easy to understand and maintain. In my future projects, I plan to incorporate more detailed comments and docstrings.

### Lessons From Pitfalls

In this project, I faced some challenges:

1. **Efficiency**: I learned the importance of writing efficient code. One challenge was optimizing the ship overlap check, which I realized could be improved by checking only the newly placed ship instead of the entire board.

2. **Debugging**: The debugging process was a learning curve. It showed me how better code modularity can help isolate issues and streamline the debugging process.

3. **User Experience**: I learned how the user interface impacts user experience. It encouraged me to focus on creating more user-friendly interfaces in the future.

### Future Improvements

With the valuable lessons learned from this project, I have a clear roadmap for my future endeavors:

1. **Detailed Planning**: I aim to spend more time on planning and designing the code architecture before diving into coding, using tools like pseudocode or flowcharts.

2. **Advanced Features**: To further push my Python skills, I'll explore using more advanced Python libraries and features in my future projects.

3. **Testing**: I now appreciate the importance of unit testing and plan to implement them in future projects to catch bugs early on.

4. **Refactoring**: I've realized the importance of regular code refactoring to improve efficiency, readability, and modularity. This practice will help prevent potential problems and maintain the code more easily.

Overall, this project was a fantastic learning experience and a stepping stone for more complex and refined projects in the future.
