# Python Battle Ship ⚓️
Code Institute Project 3 

## Resources

YouTube as always is a great source of inspiration and guidence, [Knowledge Mavens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1WRCrd_HQ), and  [Python Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwpS_ac8uk0&t=1s) were incredibly useful for visualising what I was creating and giving me an idea about how I wanted my project to look like. <br>
As always, I used code snippets and ideas from Mozilla Developer Docs, Stack Overflow and w3school. <br>
Additionally, I referred to the [Python Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). <br>
Of course, when I first started researching this project, I wanted to make sure I understood the game, so another resource would be [Wikipedia Battle Ship Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) <br>






## Instructions
This is a straightforward Battleship game implemented entirely in Python, where you compete against an AI opponent. <br>
The system is designed to be user-friendly and can adapt to suit your requirements. It provides a straightforward function that facilitates the gameplay.<br>

In this game, your goal is to locate and obliterate your adversary's vessels. You commence the game by strategically placing your 5 battleships in either horizontal or vertical positions on your grid. The positioning of your ships is crucial, so make sure to think about it carefully.<br>

As the game progresses, your task is to guess the location of your opponent's ships. If your guess is correct, you reveal part of the enemy's ship. Your goal is to sink all your enemy's ships before they sink yours. <br> 
So, get ready to strategize, guess, and aim carefully to defeat the enemy and claim victory over the sea! <br>
